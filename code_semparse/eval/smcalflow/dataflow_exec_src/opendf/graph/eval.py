# recursive eval:
# Evaluation proceeds bottom up.
# As a rule, we assume that when a node is evaluated, all of its children have already been SUCCESSFULLY evaluated.
# This removes the need for each node's exec() logic to test if its inputs have been successfully evaluated.
# From this assumption, it follows that once an exception has been raised:
#   - the exception is stored in the dialog_context (attached to the node which raised it)
#   - evaluation is "blocked" from this node up, but sibling nodes, and theit children, WILL be evaluated.
#     (the first found exception is the one which will be reported to user, later exceptions may be stored or not,
#     depending on config flags).
#   - (in case this was called from the "main") this exception will be reported to the user.
# Note that the inputs of a node are held in an ORDERED dictionary - this way the developer can control the
#      order of evaluation.
#
# Note: the presence of exceptions may affect the behavior of the "salience model" in prioritizing candidate
#       nodes for revise/refer
#
# A node can override the default logic of exception/evaluation - the function node.allows_exception(e) lets the node
# do two things (typically at most one of these per node):
#   1. given the exception, decides if the node should be evaluated of not
#     - In this case, the node has to handle exceptions in its inputs
#   2. given the exception, create a follow-up exception
#     - This will be an exception of a different type, "chained" to the original exception,
#       and attached to the current node
#
# Note: if node.eval_res is set to True, then its result will be evaluated.
#       if an exception is then raised, and node.res_block is True, then it will be treated as if
# 	       the exception was raised by the current node  (otherwise, execution will continue normally)
#
# Returns:
#   - ok: True if this node was evaluated and no exceptions were raised
#   - e:  a LIST of exceptions which occurred under the current node
#         - possibly under result nodes as well
#         - possibly modified list
