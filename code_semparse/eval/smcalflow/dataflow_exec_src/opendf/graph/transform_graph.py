# we translate by traversing the graph (bottom up)
# There are some important differences with eval:
#  - when translating, the input is an isolated graph - not connected to any other graph;
#  - the graph is a strictly a tree (but later we may allow node name assignment and reuse);
#  - we are not EXECUTING any node (hence creating results based on global graph context or external DB)
#       we are just adding computational steps (without executing them!);
#  - the added computational steps may depend on context (i.e. we look UP the graph and possibly behave differently,
#       depending on the node's ancestors);
#  - the translation modifies only INPUTS - it does not create outputs.
