    #    more complicated when it comes to partial time - for fields which are "practically periodic" (i.e. their
    #    period is less than what the event duration can reasonably be (which can depend on the event)) this transfer
    #    does not apply:
    #      - e.g. start>Monday may not mean end>Monday for a vacation, but for a meeting it may. (easy to implement)
